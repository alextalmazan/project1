Hello World
snidely epic odd
bricklayers scream leerily
ranting, grieving bear

invisible short
greedy pebbles clash, quailing
gracelessly, sneezing
Love grows all alone
Howling wind dwells in the past
Music plays carefree
numbly, destiny
jabbing colosseum builds
blissfully, rudely


Goodbye World!
